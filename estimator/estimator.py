    """
    Calculate the causal penalized regression estimator based on BÃ¼hlmann's invariance principle.
    
    This method implements the causal penalized regression estimator that estimates environment-specific 
    coefficients (beta_envs) and a global coefficient (beta) by minimizing:
    
        sum_{e in E} ||Y^e - X^e beta^e||^2 + lambda * sum_{e in E} ||beta^e - beta||^2,
    
    where:
      - beta^e are the environment-specific coefficients.
      - beta is the global (invariant) coefficient that represents causal parameters.
      - lambda controls the strength of the penalization.
    
    The iterative algorithm alternates between:
    1. Updating environment-specific coefficients (beta_envs) given the current global beta
    2. Updating the global beta as the median of environment-specific coefficients
    
    Parameters:
        X_envs (list of np.array): List of predictor matrices, one per environment.
                                  Each matrix should have shape (n_samples, n_features).
        Y_envs (list of np.array): List of response vectors, one per environment.
                                  Each vector should have shape (n_samples,).
        lambda_reg (float): Regularization parameter controlling the penalization intensity.
                           Higher values enforce more similarity between environment-specific 
                           and global coefficients.
        tol (float, optional): Tolerance for convergence. The algorithm stops when the
                              change in beta is below this threshold. Defaults to 1e-6.
        max_iter (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations. Defaults to 1000.
        track_history (bool, optional): If True, track and return the history of beta values
                                       for convergence analysis. Defaults to False.
        
    Returns:
        beta (np.array): The estimated global regression coefficients that are invariant 
                        across environments, representing causal parameters.
        beta_envs (list of np.array): The estimated environment-specific coefficients.
        beta_history (list of np.array, optional): History of beta values across iterations 
                                                 if track_history=True.
    
    Notes:
        - The median is used for the global beta calculation to provide robustness against
          outlier environments.
        - The method assumes that the true causal mechanism is invariant across environments,
          while non-causal mechanisms may vary.
